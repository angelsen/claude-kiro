# Feature: Documentation Site with Mini-Framework

## Overview

Transform the existing GitHub Pages landing page into a complete documentation system with a reusable, shadcn-inspired mini-framework. The framework will provide consistent styling, responsive design, and component-based structure for all documentation pages while maintaining the existing visual identity. This evolution focuses on creating a **complete documentation system** that properly represents Claude Kiro as a methodology/workflow tool, not just hooks.

## Specification Heritage

**Evolves From:** github-pages-site
**Preserves:**
- Existing landing page design (`docs/index.html`)
- Visual identity (glass-morphism, gradients, animations)
- SVG assets and branding
- Install script functionality

**Supersedes:**
- Single-page approach → Multi-page documentation site
- Inline styles → Framework-based CSS system
- Basic structure → Component-based architecture

**Evolution Reason:** The landing page successfully introduces Claude Kiro, but lacks comprehensive documentation. Users need detailed guides on methodology, CLI usage, slash commands, and workflow examples. A mini-framework ensures consistency as we expand the documentation.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Documentation Framework Setup
**As a** documentation maintainer
**I want** a reusable CSS/JS framework for all doc pages
**So that** new pages have consistent styling and components without duplicating code

**Acceptance Criteria (EARS notation):**
- WHEN creating a new doc page, THE SYSTEM SHALL provide a base template with navigation and layout
- WHEN applying styles, THE SYSTEM SHALL use CSS custom properties (variables) for theming
- WHEN components are needed, THE SYSTEM SHALL provide reusable HTML patterns (cards, callouts, code blocks)
- WHEN the framework loads, THE SYSTEM SHALL support responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- WHEN users navigate, THE SYSTEM SHALL maintain visual consistency across all pages
- WHEN developers add pages, THE SYSTEM SHALL require minimal CSS writing (use framework classes)

### Story 2: Methodology Documentation Page
**As a** developer learning Claude Kiro
**I want** comprehensive methodology documentation
**So that** I understand the spec-driven workflow and its benefits

**Acceptance Criteria (EARS notation):**
- WHEN viewing `/methodology.html`, THE SYSTEM SHALL explain the complete workflow: requirements → design → tasks → implementation
- WHEN reading methodology, THE SYSTEM SHALL emphasize this is more than hooks (slash commands, output styles, TodoWrite integration)
- WHEN learning the approach, THE SYSTEM SHALL include visual workflow diagrams
- WHEN understanding EARS notation, THE SYSTEM SHALL provide clear examples with explanations
- WHEN seeing benefits, THE SYSTEM SHALL link to Kiro.dev for the original methodology philosophy
- WHEN comparing to alternatives, THE SYSTEM SHALL highlight advantages over ad-hoc development

### Story 3: Getting Started Guide
**As a** new Claude Kiro user
**I want** step-by-step setup instructions
**So that** I can get my first project running quickly

**Acceptance Criteria (EARS notation):**
- WHEN viewing `/getting-started.html`, THE SYSTEM SHALL provide installation steps (`uv tool install claude-kiro`)
- WHEN following the guide, THE SYSTEM SHALL show the `ck init` workflow with expected output
- WHEN setting up, THE SYSTEM SHALL explain what files are created and why
- WHEN learning to use it, THE SYSTEM SHALL demonstrate creating a first spec with `/spec:create`
- WHEN troubleshooting, THE SYSTEM SHALL reference `ck doctor` command
- WHEN users complete the guide, THE SYSTEM SHALL link to next steps (methodology, CLI reference)

### Story 4: CLI Reference Documentation
**As a** Claude Kiro user
**I want** complete CLI command documentation
**So that** I can reference all `ck` commands and options

**Acceptance Criteria (EARS notation):**
- WHEN viewing `/cli.html`, THE SYSTEM SHALL document all `ck` commands (`init`, `doctor`, `hook`)
- WHEN reading command docs, THE SYSTEM SHALL show syntax, options, and examples for each
- WHEN seeing examples, THE SYSTEM SHALL use tabbed code blocks (installation/usage patterns)
- WHEN learning advanced usage, THE SYSTEM SHALL document hook testing and debugging
- WHEN referencing commands, THE SYSTEM SHALL provide copy-able command snippets
- WHEN understanding output, THE SYSTEM SHALL show example command output

### Story 5: Slash Commands Reference
**As a** Claude Code user with Claude Kiro
**I want** documentation for all slash commands
**So that** I know how to use `/spec:create`, `/spec:implement`, `/spec:review`

**Acceptance Criteria (EARS notation):**
- WHEN viewing `/commands.html`, THE SYSTEM SHALL document all three spec slash commands
- WHEN learning `/spec:create`, THE SYSTEM SHALL explain the 3-phase workflow with approval gates
- WHEN using `/spec:implement`, THE SYSTEM SHALL show how task context is provided
- WHEN running `/spec:review`, THE SYSTEM SHALL explain the review criteria
- WHEN seeing examples, THE SYSTEM SHALL show real command usage with screenshots/diagrams
- WHEN understanding integration, THE SYSTEM SHALL explain how commands work with TodoWrite and hooks

### Story 6: Examples and Workflows
**As a** developer adopting Claude Kiro
**I want** real-world examples and workflows
**So that** I can see the methodology in practice

**Acceptance Criteria (EARS notation):**
- WHEN viewing `/examples.html`, THE SYSTEM SHALL provide complete workflow examples
- WHEN learning patterns, THE SYSTEM SHALL show a simple feature spec from start to finish
- WHEN seeing advanced usage, THE SYSTEM SHALL demonstrate multi-task specifications
- WHEN understanding evolution, THE SYSTEM SHALL explain how specs can evolve/supersede
- WHEN viewing examples, THE SYSTEM SHALL include actual spec files (requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md)
- WHEN applying patterns, THE SYSTEM SHALL provide templates users can copy

### Story 7: Responsive Navigation
**As a** documentation reader on any device
**I want** easy navigation between doc pages
**So that** I can find information quickly

**Acceptance Criteria (EARS notation):**
- WHEN viewing on desktop, THE SYSTEM SHALL display a persistent sidebar navigation
- WHEN viewing on mobile, THE SYSTEM SHALL show a hamburger menu that expands navigation
- WHEN navigating, THE SYSTEM SHALL highlight the current page in the navigation
- WHEN reading long pages, THE SYSTEM SHALL provide a table of contents for internal links
- WHEN transitioning pages, THE SYSTEM SHALL maintain scroll position awareness
- WHEN using keyboard, THE SYSTEM SHALL support keyboard navigation

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Pages must load in < 1 second on typical connections
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance (semantic HTML, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- **Browser Support:** Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - last 2 versions)
- **Mobile Experience:** Fully responsive, touch-friendly, readable on small screens
- **SEO:** Proper meta tags, semantic HTML, clear page titles
- **Maintainability:** Framework classes documented, easy to add new pages

## Constraints

- **Technical Constraints:**
  - Static HTML/CSS/JS only (GitHub Pages limitation)
  - No build process (direct HTML editing)
  - Must work with existing landing page
  - Preserve existing visual identity

- **Content Constraints:**
  - Documentation must emphasize complete system (not just hooks)
  - Link appropriately: Claude Code docs (technical), Kiro.dev (methodology), our docs (usage)
  - Must reflect current CLI tool (`ck` command, not `ckh-*`)

- **Timeline Constraints:**
  - Framework must be reusable for future doc pages
  - Prioritize core pages: methodology, getting-started, cli, commands, examples

## Out of Scope

This feature does NOT include:
- Search functionality (future enhancement)
- Version switcher (single version for now)
- API reference (if needed later)
- Interactive tutorials or playgrounds
- Automated doc generation from code
- Dark mode toggle (CSS vars prepared, toggle deferred)
- Internationalization (English only)
