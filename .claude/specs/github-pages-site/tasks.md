## Implementation Notes

### Content Extraction Strategy

Since Kiro's homepage HTML is too large to read directly, use targeted content extraction:

```bash
# Extract specific testimonials
grep -A 5 'class="testimonial"' resources/scraped/kiro.dev/.meta/kiro.dev.wget_mirror/index.html | head -50

# Extract feature descriptions
grep -o '<h3[^>]*>.*</h3>' resources/scraped/kiro.dev/.meta/kiro.dev.wget_mirror/index.html | head -10
```

### Key Adaptation Rules

1. **Hero Headline:**
   - Original: "The AI IDE for prototype to production"
   - Adapted: "Spec-Driven Development for Claude Code"

2. **CTA Buttons:**
   - Original: "Download Kiro" / "Join Waitlist"
   - Adapted: "Get Started on GitHub" / "View on GitHub"

3. **Feature Titles:**
   - Keep structure, update terminology
   - Example: "Tame complexity with spec-driven development" ‚Üí "Structured Requirements with EARS Notation"

4. **Testimonials:**
   - Remove IDE-specific references
   - Keep role/attribution intact
   - Replace "Kiro" with "spec-driven development" or "this methodology"

### GitHub Repository Links

All links should point to (update with actual repo):
- Main repo: `https://github.com/USERNAME/claude-kiro`
- VISION.md: `https://github.com/USERNAME/claude-kiro/blob/master/VISION.md`
- Implementation: `https://github.com/USERNAME/claude-kiro/blob/master/synthesis/phase1-implementation.md`

### File Size Budget

- HTML structure: ~20KB
- Inline CSS: ~30KB
- Content (text): ~50KB
- Ghost icon SVG: ~5KB
- Purple line art SVG: ~8KB
